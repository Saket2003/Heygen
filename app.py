Common allergens include pollen, dust mites, pet dander, certain foods, insect stings, and medications. Symptoms can range from mild (sneezing, runny nose, itchy eyes) to severe (difficulty breathing, anaphylaxis). Management strategies include avoiding triggers, over-the-counter or prescription medications, and in some cases, immunotherapy (allergy shots). For food allergies, careful label reading and carrying emergency medication for severe reactions is important. If you experience concerning allergy symptoms or suspect a new allergy, please consult a healthcare provider for proper evaluation and treatment recommendations."
